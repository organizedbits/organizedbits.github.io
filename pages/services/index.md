            <h3>Software Integration & Development</h3>
            <p>
                Our specialty is software integration.  We build "Org Centric" integrations.  This means that we design and implement our integrations in such a way as to minimize the coupling between the systems.  This prevents an Organization from getting locked into any particular software.  Our integration approach allows an Organization to replace integration components without having a major impact.  This is accomplished by implementing an Organization abstraction layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even in today's world full of powerful COTS and SaaS products there are times when only a custom solution is appropriate.  Our expert developers are intimately familiar with the SDLC and can walk you through all aspects of the process.

            <p>
                Technology changes at a rapid rate. However, it is difficult for businesses to keep abreast with these changes. Inevitably this leads to businesses operating and developing with technologies that are no longer current.  This is acceptable up to a point.  However, eventually a threshold is reached where further development using older technologies simply becomes technical debt.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have concerns about your technologies and recognize the need for updating them but need assistance, we can help.
